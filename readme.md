[Beer displayer](https://vieuxloupgris.github.io/jsweb2.2/)

## 2.2 - Beer displayer

Use the [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2) to make an application that displays beers. For each beer it should display its name, tagline, its year of first brewery and its image.

Each beer should be presented in a rectangle and multiple rectangles should be shown on the same line. The application should be responsive.

*Hey, while you're at it you could take a look at [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) which is already included in the exercise theme. Maybe it contains useful tools to help present all that...*
